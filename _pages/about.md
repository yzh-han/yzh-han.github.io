My principal research interest is in **distributed & intelligent systems**, especially how to make machine learning workloads run efficiently and adaptively across cloud–edge–device environments. I have experience working on federated continual learning, distributed optimization, and system-level coordination, applying these ideas to problems like resource scheduling and network optimization. One of my recent projects, [Cluster-MoE](https://github.com/yzh-han/cluster-moe), proposed an adaptive scheduling framework for asynchronous drift in federated learning, achieving notable efficiency improvements over existing approaches.

Moreover, I am interested in the system-level challenges of **distributed AI inference**, particularly how heterogeneous computing nodes can coordinate and reuse inference caches effectively. In the future, I hope to explore ways to address these challenges and reduce redundant computation, improving the latency and energy efficiency of large-scale AI systems across cloud–edge–device environments.

Currently, I completed my Master study in Computer Science (with Distinction) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/),
where I was listed on the Dean’s List for academic excellence.
Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at [North China Electric Power University](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/).
I also have a two-year experience in Urban Studies at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/),
which helped me develop an interdisciplinary perspective on intelligent systems in real-world environments.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
