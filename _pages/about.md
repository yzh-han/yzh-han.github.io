My principal research background lies in **distributed and intelligent systems**, where I focused on making machine learning workloads—such as those in computer vision and large language models—run efficiently and adaptively across heterogeneous cloud–edge–device environments.

In my previous research, I explored topics in federated continual learning, distributed optimization, and system-level coordination, applying these ideas to problems like resource scheduling, inference acceleration, and network optimization. One of my recent projects, [Cluster-MoE](https://github.com/yzh-han/cluster-moe), proposed an adaptive scheduling framework for asynchronous drift in federated learning, achieving notable efficiency improvements over existing approaches.

Recently, I have been exploring **multimodal large language models (MLLMs)** and their applications in **Earth Observation (EO)**. I am particularly fascinated by how multimodal foundation models can integrate visual, spatial, and textual data for large-scale environmental and urban understanding. My goal is to build intelligent AI systems that bridge efficient system design and multimodal model capability, thereby enabling scalable and efficient AI applications.

<!-- My research aims to co-design system architectures and multimodal foundation models (MLLMs) so that system-level scheduling, caching, and optimization directly support and enhance model-level perception and reasoning.
The goal is to enable scalable and efficient multimodal AI inference across cloud–edge–device environments, with applications in Earth Observation and visual–language understanding. -->


Currently, I completed my Master study in Computer Science (with Distinction) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/),
where I was listed on the Dean’s List for academic excellence.
Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at [North China Electric Power University](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/).
I also have two years of experience in Urban Studies at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/),
and three years of work experience in geoinformation and remote sensing, which helped me develop an interdisciplinary perspective on intelligent systems in earth and urban environments.
